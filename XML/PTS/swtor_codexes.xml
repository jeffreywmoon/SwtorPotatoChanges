    <Body Value="Rising above the Valley of the Dark Lords, the Sith Academy is a monument to the power of the dark side and the might of the Sith Empire. Would-be students throughout Imperial space compete for the privilege of studying within the Academy halls, but only those strong in the Force are selected--and most of those perish in the struggle to become Sith.&#xA;&#xA;Beyond the training rooms lay many secrets that remain hidden to all but the most powerful Sith Lords. Higher levels contain chambers for members of the Dark Council, where few living creatures are permitted. Whispered rumors suggest that the Emperor himself has a sanctum within the Academy, but no one has seen the Emperor on Korriban for many years.&#xA;" />

    <Body Value="What is now called Drelliad village was established decades ago as the private retreat of Ord Mantell's most celebrated smuggler, the voluptuous and quick-witted Ulla Drelliad. In the years after Ulla's death, her hideaway was transformed into a thriving trading post. Now, Drelliad village is hotly contested territory where separatist and Republic forces battle in the streets, and the handful of civilians who haven't already fled hide in basements and behind locked doors.&#xA;&#xA;Although small, Drelliad village occupies a critical point between separatist-controlled territory and areas still loyal to the Republic. More importantly, what used to be Ulla's personal docking bay is now one of the only starship landing pads outside of local Republic headquarters. If Drelliad village falls entirely to the separatists, it will bring the enemy one step closer to securing the entire island.&#xA;" />

He resisted the indoctrination process and the Emperor's dark draw longer than any other--until the strain of resistance became too much and his mind snapped.&#xA;&#xA;Once in the Emperor's thrall, Iven became the most ruthless of all the guardsmen, never allowing his intentions to be questioned nor abiding attempts to be reasoned with. In his later years, as a training commandant himself, Iven had a candidate kill rate of over 80 percent, making for a smaller--but ultimately stronger--Imperial Guard." />

Part of the Empire's lack of success rooting out these rebels is due to an inability to detect such nondescript enemies until it is too late.&#xA;&#xA;Over the years, thousands of ordinary people have made the ultimate sacrifice for Balmorra, learning to hoist a blaster, training in burnt-out factories and toxic wastelands, and willingly dying to strike a blow against the hated Empire. To much of the citizenry, the resistance is made up of heroes--friends and neighbors who refused to suffer in silence. Other Balmorrans, however, wish the resistance would fade away, and believe it is past time to peacefully accept Imperial governance.&#xA;" />

After the fighting ended, he was kept in trust by the re-formed Jedi Order, much to his dismay; with the galaxy still in turmoil, the Jedi were concerned that HK-47 would start &quot;helpfully&quot; removing troublesome individuals. Then, during routine maintenance, an engineer accidentally activated an unknown command in HK-47's systems. Soon after, the droid disappeared from Jedi custody and left for deep space.&#xA;&#xA;The Jedi's records claim that HK-47 has been destroyed and rebuilt several times since his creation. Darth Malgus's agents are said to have recently recovered HK-47's components from a mysterious facility built into an asteroid.

    <Body Value="Why employ a single droid in combat when you can have two droids with different strengths and weaknesses working in concert? That was how the astromech who calls himself BO-55 convinced the Ravagers to allow him to supervise the construction of Blaster, Rishi's oversized weapon of devastation who enters into battle with a child-like enthusiasm and several pounds of high-grade detonite.&#xA;&#xA;BO-55 himself was once a discontinued model destined for the scrap heap until the Ravagers' engineering guru Torque reprogrammed and refitted him. Now he's the sort of droid a bloodthirsty pirate would gladly call friend. Together with Blaster, BO-55 plots out elaborate &quot;operations&quot; designed to inflict maximum embarrassment and carnage. Never content to let Blaster have all the fun, BO-55 can manage just fine in a firefight himself and will gladly join his creation side-by-side in the thick of it." />

Common slicing targets include electronic safes, data stations, security mainframes and biometric footlockers. These targets contain credits, rare tech schematics used to construct Cybertech gadgets, vehicles and space upgrades, and mission discovery objects that unlock challenging missions that can potentially yield great rewards. Slicers can send their companions on missions to retrieve these valuable items. &#xA;&#xA;Slicing missions can return with rare tech parts used to construct prototype and artifact augments. These can be slotted into exceptionally crafted items. Other possible mission rewards include augment schematics that can be learned by armormechs, armstechs and synthweavers. &#xA;&#xA;Recommended Crafting Skills: All (for mission discoveries), Armormech, Armstech, Cybertech (for tech schematics) and Synthweaving." />

It stopped in neutral sectors and broadcasted its coordinates on coded HoloNet frequencies. Criminals converged on the station and conducted business before it jumped back to hyperspace, always remaining one step ahead of the law.&#xA;&#xA;Recently, however, Port Nowhere suffered a major hyperdrive malfunction that left it stranded. When or whether the station shall resume its former mobility remains a mystery." />

    <Body Value="Toward the end of the Great War, Republic Special Forces Colonel Laren Omas--one of the key figures behind the Republic's weapons research projects--assembled a team of the galaxy's greatest scientists. Together, they would do what no single scientist could: design a weapon capable of turning back the Imperial threat.&#xA;&#xA;The scientists, led by Doctor Nasan Godera, were initially skeptical. But Omas had worked with many of them before, and over the course of weeks the group developed a plan. They would build a &quot;Shadow Arsenal&quot; of interplanetary missiles, each armed with a cloaking device and a warhead of continent-shaking power. The Shadow Arsenal would be the ultimate deterrent--a weapon impossible to defend against and too powerful to ignore.&#xA;&#xA;The group began falling apart long before work was completed. Colonel Omas's death on Hoth was the final blow, and the scientists went their respective ways--save for Doctor Godera. Godera stubbornly continued, secretly building the arsenal on Quesh until, faced with the finished product, even he realized its destructive potential went too far.&#xA;&#xA;The Shadow Arsenal was an indiscriminate, catastrophic weapon. It would kill millions of civilians along with its intended targets, and this was not something Godera could abide. His future weapons would be different--built to imprison, to guard or to selectively target.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, the Shadow Arsenal was abandoned. Until now." />

    <Body Value="&quot;Zenith&quot; is the code name of a Balmorran revolutionary fighter who has made a career out of hurting the Empire. Once a member of a powerful resistance cell broken up by Imperial infiltrators, Zenith has struck out on his own, gathering followers from Balmorra's oppressed population to launch sneak attacks, raids and bombings against the occupying Imperial forces. &#xA;&#xA;Years spent in hiding and seeing the plight of Balmorran citizens have left Zenith with a deep-seated paranoia and hatred of the Empire--especially Balmorra's Sith governor, Darth Lachris. Nothing enrages him more than those who collaborate with the oppressors; he has been known to refuse aid to Balmorrans who cooperate with Imperial soldiers. The sacrifices he has endured have also nurtured Zenith's ambitions--when Balmorra is finally free, someone will have to ensure her new government is strong enough to prevent another occupation.&#xA;&#xA;Likes: Hurting Imperials, standing up for the weak, stubbornness, resolve&#xA;Dislikes: Mercy to the Empire, betrayal, second chances for those who do wrong&#xA;&#xA;Primary Stat: Cunning&#xA;Secondary Stat: Endurance&#xA;&#xA;Primary Weapon: Sniper Rifle&#xA;Secondary Weapon: Scattergun" />

The planet Erigorm, represented by Augin Blaesus, has recorded and administrated the Republic's finances for centuries; its secession could destroy the Republic's financial markets.&#xA;&#xA;Not all members of the Rift Alliance are hostile toward the Republic, however.

The Jedi seer Krynda Draay, who had lost her husband in the conflict, blamed herself for not foreseeing Exar Kun's corruption as a Sith Lord and decided to take action. Having trained the order's visionaries for years, she secretly created a Jedi Covenant without the Council's knowledge, binding the most powerful Jedi seers into a WatchCircle.&#xA;&#xA;The Covenant's task was simple: Watch for Sith influences and eliminate them before they became a threat. Funded by Krynda Draay's vast family wealth, the Covenant quietly recruited Jedi--usually those believed missing in action--as its shadows and operatives and sought out Sith artifacts to destroy.

While a lightsaber hilt is often customized by its owner, the blade's color is determined by its crystal; red, purple and orange are the most common colors among the Sith, though other colors, such as magenta and cyan, are known to exist.&#xA;&#xA;Acolytes seeking to wield these weapons are required to begin their trials using an electroblade training sword, an unwieldy device designed to cause painful shocks to the target. If an acolyte is found worthy, he may hone his abilities with an ancient Sith warblade--a weapon used in an era before lightsabers, crafted by pureblooded artisans. In the end, only the strongest and deadliest acolytes may earn a lightsaber for themselves, seizing one from a failed Sith or Jedi or uncovering it in the depths of a tomb." />

Because of this, some members of the first expedition to Tython recommended restoring Kaleth and making it the new settlement of the Jedi Order. The Jedi Council decided against this, however, preferring to study Kaleth and its history from a distance." />

Where the Hutt Cartel has a clear, centralized authority in Hutt Space, the Exchange is a distributed network of gangs coordinated via the HoloNet; where the Hutt Cartel favors galactic neutrality, the Exchange sees the Empire as an untapped resource ready to bleed credits and the Republic as a living shield protecting its gangsters from Imperial retaliation.&#xA;&#xA;Three centuries ago, the Exchange was arguably the most influential criminal organization in the Republic. However, an internal power struggle to claim the territory of the infamous Davik Kang after his death left the Exchange in disarray, allowing the Hutt Cartel to seize control over many of its operations. It took many decades before the &quot;new breed&quot; of Exchange criminals arose, and the current syndicate is a different animal than the old.&#xA;&#xA;Active in slicing, extortion, spice dealing and weapons running, the Exchange is rapidly reclaiming lost territory, taking advantage of riots, gang wars and other acts of blatant violence to gain ground even on Hutt worlds like Nar Shaddaa. But the Empire is swiftly becoming a greater adversary than the Hutts--the Exchange wants to be the first crime syndicate to make solid inroads into Imperial space and is willing to kill whoever it takes to get there." />

Champala's government is famous for being even-handed, ensuring a high quality of life for all its citizens while showing special favor to none. This mentality is often borne out in Chagrian individuals; in Republic politics, Chagrians are often painted as naive idealists by their opponents, but they can be fiercely devoted to their constituents." />

The Jedi all perished when the ship they used to escape Azamin's stronghold exploded due to a mechanical malfunction that was most likely due to sabotage.&#xA;&#xA;Despite his wanton ambition, Decimus is fiercely loyal to the Emperor, and he was chosen to lead the Imperial invasion of Corellia. Living up to his reputation, Decimus devised a plan that allowed the Empire to seize control of the world with virtually no significant resistance, giving the Imperials an early upper hand over the Republic." />

It was only happenstance that caused Republic scouts to notice first the tropical rifts that defied the freezing temperatures, and then the strange vaults and the alien structures burrowing into the core of the planet.&#xA;&#xA;Top-secret expeditions attempted to explore the alien vaults, until the extent of the dangers became apparent. At last, select Senators worked with the Strategic Information Service to construct Belsavis prison--a facility with two purposes. First, to guard, contain and study the terrible alien structures on the planet. And second, to create a prison for the Republic--one where the most powerful offenders could be placed within the Rakata's cells, and where lesser threats could be isolated on the most secure planet in the galaxy." />

There is no cargo that can't be offloaded here and no job so dirty that someone won't take it. The families of migrant workers live alongside grizzled Republic veterans who settled on Nar Shaddaa to retire in style, happily turning a blind eye to the darker activities around them.&#xA;&#xA;Over the past decade, the gangs and pirates of the Corellian Sector have become overshadowed by the presence of the Exchange. Once a group mentioned primarily in HoloNet information crime reports, the Exchange crime syndicate has found an army of able recruits on Nar Shaddaa willing to back its slicers and spice-refiners with muscle--much to the dismay of the Hutt Cartel." />

Upon the recent disappearance of the Emperor, he seized the opportunity to create a new Empire--one that embraces alien cultures and is strengthened by diversity. All allies of the new Empire will be considered equal citizens, guided by Imperial discipline and values. Personal strength and accomplishment, not genetics, will determine an Imperial's fate.&#xA;&#xA;Malgus is aware that many will not share his vision. But with a stealth armada at his command and the Emperor's space station as his base, he is prepared to prove the power of his new Empire to all dissenters." />

They sought to reclaim forgotten knowledge and wisdom left behind by ancient Masters, scouring the planet for holocrons and Jedi artifacts to replace those that had been lost during the destruction of the temple on Coruscant.

Through the Force, it becomes an extension of the wielder; serving as both a powerful tool for defense and a devastating weapon against the dark side. Padawans, however, typically use electroblade training swords until they have proven themselves worthy. Only then can a Padawan make a pilgrimage to the Forge on Tython to construct a lightsaber in accordance with ancient Jedi traditions.&#xA;&#xA;Lightsabers come in both single- and double-bladed forms, and their blades can be a variety of colors. Blue, green and yellow are the most common among the Jedi, though there are examples of other hues such as magenta and cyan. The color of a given lightsaber's blade is largely determined by the crystals in the hilt that power the weapon. Different crystals confer varying properties on the weapon, allowing each lightsaber to be customized by its creator." />

Furthermore, the familiar distribution of spore sacs and unique flora suggest not only an attempt to create an environment conducive to their habitation, but also a robust fungal signature stored within the virus's genetic code.

Their rivalry spanned many years and countless worlds as they scored bigger heists and hunted rarer treasures, punctuated by the occasional spat of violence. Diago Hixan claimed victory after Nok Drayen died, bringing many cunning and merciless criminals throughout the galaxy under his heel.&#xA;&#xA;In his prime, one of Diago Hixan's greatest treasures was the beautiful Shassa Dalle. To his dismay, she was eventually &quot;stolen&quot; by none other than Nok Drayen. For years Diago Hixan made many impassioned attempts to take her back from his rival, but his pursuit ended after he accidentally caused Shassa's death." />

    <Body Value="Most commanders prefer to rely on rigorous training and good equipment to succeed, but no advantage can be ignored when soldiers' lives are at stake. Since the Great War, the use of military adrenals--safe, nonaddictive stimulants that improve a soldier's endurance, stamina or reflexes--has become more common. A good stock of adrenals can keep a company fresh and on its feet during a forced march, or save wounded individuals from succumbing to their injuries before help arrives.&#xA;&#xA;Naturally, military adrenal stocks are carefully regulated and, if possible, reserved only for emergencies. It is possible for soldiers to rely on adrenals too much and overstress themselves. Theft and sale of military adrenals, which are of the highest quality, has also become a thriving cornerstone of the galactic black market, especially on worlds like Ord Mantell. &#xA;" />

The company has been continuously owned and operated for centuries by members of the Adasca royal family, and it is most famous for advancements in the fields of bioengineering and medical research. However, the company also maintains interests in markets as diverse as military droid hardware and financial services.&#xA;&#xA;Adascorp's president three centuries past, Lord Arkoh Adasca, attempted to seize galactic power using gargantuan exogorths--more commonly known as &quot;space slugs.&quot; This insane plan was foiled with Lord Adasca's death and the destruction of Adascorp headquarters. After many decades of legal reparations, the company quietly resumed operations." />

Colonized by the first explorers from Coruscant long before the development of the hyperdrive, Alsakan had been a member of the Core Worlds for centuries.&#xA;&#xA;But as the planet grew more powerful and influential, its Senators believed that Alsakan, not Coruscant, should be the capital of the Republic. A series of skirmishes called the &quot;Alsakan Conflicts&quot; broke out, slowing Republic growth as it tried to quell Alsakan's forces.&#xA;&#xA;Despite the best efforts of Republic diplomats and generals, Alsakan remained belligerent, and seventeen such uprisings would occur over the next several thousand years. Later, the battle cruisers built during the Alsakan Conflicts would inspire the Republic's Invincible-class dreadnought." />

At this point Joiners often describe the relationship as symbiotic, feeling they gain more from the Joining than the Killiks. Over time, however, their personalities become more and more subsumed, until they cannot conceive of any existence away from the hive mind.&#xA;&#xA;In turn, a nest also absorbs the knowledge, skills and personality traits of its Joiners. A single Joiner rarely changes a nest's nature, but a nest that Joins an army of warriors may become war-like, and a nest that Joins a party of explorers may gain a degree of curiosity and wanderlust.&#xA;&#xA;It is possible to medically reverse the Joining process even in the later stages.

As more pirates arrived on Rishi and the local economy began to flourish, relatively polished structures were constructed along the black-sand shores and Raider's Cove became a vacation destination for adventure and trouble seekers everywhere--a true resort for the wicked." />

In the former category are some of the most treacherous beings in the galaxy--master assassins, hardened pirates, war criminals, slavers, Sith Lords and others. &#xA;&#xA;The second category is broader--Belsavis contains escape artists, slicers and shapechangers whose crimes are relatively minor compared to the destructive madmen who dwell alongside them. Gang leaders and syndicate leaders can fall into this category as well, placed in Belsavis to isolate them from their web of criminal contacts.&#xA;&#xA;The prison administration attempts to separate prisoners of like affiliation--members of a single gang, for example, are often divided among multiple cell blocks--but prisoners not in isolation quickly form their own alliances inside Belsavis. Murder and assault are common inside the prison, and for many, protection comes in numbers." />

Through violence and cunning, he fought his way to become ruler of the Sith and united their nations through a bloody war. He later took the title &quot;Sith'ari,&quot; meaning &quot;overlord.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;King Adas's ascension may have been helped by an untrained Force sensitivity.

The targeting device is only effective at extreme close range, meaning an operative must get within several meters of an intended victim to use it. The targeting process is undetectable, and once marked, an individual can be tracked indefinitely, allowing the killing blow to be dealt hours or even days later.&#xA;&#xA;In theory, the Death Mark could save hundreds of lives, as key enemy leaders could be eliminated without the need for armies or the risk of collateral damage. In the wrong hands, however, the Death Mark becomes a weapon of terror, raining murder down from the sky." />

    <Body Value="&quot;All that is Voss comes from Voss,&quot; run the words of an ancient Voss creation myth. According to tradition, the ruin known as the Deep Cradle marks the site where the Voss were born from the substance of the planet itself. Later stories tell of how one Voss returned to the Deep Cradle and drank from the fire at the planet's heart; he knew he would perish, but that his sacrifice was necessary for the greater good. His prophetic dying words are said to have guided the ancient Voss safely through the wilderness, until they discovered the mountain where Voss-Ka now stands.&#xA;&#xA;The altars of the Deep Cradle, meditated upon by potential Mystics, reflect these myths. The Altar of Life celebrates the existence and survival of the Voss despite all odds. The Altar of Death represents the irrevocability of one's actions. Finally, the Altar of Duty stands for both the ability to choose, and the responsibility that comes with choosing correctly." />

Resistance soon came in other forms, as well: rebellious citizens, treacherous factory foremen, saboteurs posing as allies and terrorist cells all tried to thwart the Empire's attempts to fully control the industrial world. &#xA;&#xA;In response, the Empire has placed the territories it controls under strict lockdown, using a combination of propaganda and military policing to subjugate the unruly Balmorran population. Curfews are enforced and all citizens must apply for official IDs--a process that tests their loyalty to the Empire--or else be marked as resistance sympathizers and arrested. Punishments for attacks on Imperial infrastructure are regularly meted out against perpetrators' families, or even against the entire population; the lesson must be taught." />

It also rendered the transport's communications equipment useless, cutting off Makeb from the rest of the galaxy.&#xA;&#xA;Although Makeb engineers eventually devised a reliable communication system that compensates for the interference, traveling through the atmosphere is still incredibly dangerous. In the early days of Makeb's colonization, daredevil pilots calling themselves the Lightning Runners built specialized fliers from salvage and attempted to navigate the skies.

Reflections of reality are shunned. Instead, the truly great statues capture the idealized Hutt form and portray the glorious mass of their subject. From its golden tail to ornate helmet, there exists no finer Hutt statue than that of Karagga the Unyielding." />

Beneath the sleek metal exterior and the interior wood paneling is an unmatched density of sophisticated circuits, wires, cooling systems and other components, many never before used in a starship of this size.&#xA;&#xA;The X-70B shields its military-grade hardware from virtually all scanners, allowing it to travel unnoticed among civilian vessels. Its own sensor capabilities are formidable, and although not normally equipped with a cloaking device (due to heat and power concerns), the ship can be refitted with such a module for short-term missions.&#xA;&#xA;Maintenance work on the X-70B is extraordinarily difficult and expensive due to the super-compressed nature of its mechanics, making the Phantom-class an unlikely candidate for wide-scale production. This difficulty is only aggravated by the fact that Imperial Intelligence refuses to share its ship specifications with the Imperial military.&#xA;" />

After killing his mentor, Nadd traveled to distant Onderon and established himself in the capital Iziz as a tyrant, twisting the city's culture to a Sith ideal. &#xA;&#xA;Nadd would often banish criminals beyond Iziz's walls, intending for them to die in Onderon's dangerous jungles. However, many of these criminals survived and began taming the jungle beasts as mounts. These &quot;Beast Riders&quot; formed a guerrilla force that eventually went to war against Iziz. Nadd fought them fiercely, but the jungle had honed the Beast Riders into formidable enemies. &#xA;&#xA;The civil war continued even after Nadd's eventual death. Nadd was entombed below the city of Iziz, where his influence on Iziz's rulers would be felt for centuries." />

    <Body Value="In the beginning, the Gormak were the only species on Voss--semisentient humanoids marked with a strong, though undeveloped, affinity for the Force. However, the history of the Gormak was forever altered several thousand years ago when they were discovered and enslaved by a small group of Sith. &#xA;&#xA;A minor Jedi contingent of explorers arrived soon after. Bowing to pressure from a group of Gormak elders who had escaped the Sith, the Jedi taught a handful of the tribes the ways of the Force. They had no way of knowing that doing so would alter the path of their natural evolution so that they underwent profound physical and mental changes over the next several generations. The creatures ceased to be Gormak and became something else entirely--the Voss. &#xA;&#xA;The Jedi preached temperance and defense but the newly formed Voss immediately attacked the Sith who still lurked among the Gormak primitives. The Voss destroyed the Sith, but in the process they were touched by the dark side, further altering their radically sensitive evolutionary path. Later the small group of Jedi explorers disappeared, having gone home or dying to accident or Voss aggression. Whatever the case, the strange happenings on Voss were never recorded in any archive.&#xA;&#xA;Ascending to the top of Voss's tallest peak, the new species turned to its most powerful Force-users for leadership. Myths about their origins began as the newly ordained &quot;Mystics&quot; tried to explain what had happened and eventually it was believed that the Voss had simply always been. In time this myth became the accepted truth, until even the Mystics themselves forgot the real origins of their people." />

Finally Nok Drayen attacked Vandelhelm's headquarters, while simultaneously having the leader of the Rath Cartel assassinated.

Prisoners who require specialized holding facilities are shipped to higher-security areas, but here, inmates are permitted to gather and to work, albeit under strict supervision.&#xA;&#xA;When the Empire inserted its forces onto the planet, it converted the remains of a camp used by early Republic explorers into a fortified lodgment.

Individuals with extraordinary gifts of healing and prophecy, Mystics most often live in seclusion, using their talents to guide their people. &#xA;&#xA;Mystic visionaries experience prophetic visions, which are carefully studied by interpreters at the Tower of Prophecy before being passed on to the ruling Three; it is said that no Mystic's vision has failed to come true, giving immense weight to any statement by a Mystic visionary. At the Shrine of Healing, Mystic healers use intense meditation and rituals to cure their patients, often of ailments that resist any other treatment.&#xA;&#xA;Becoming a Mystic is a difficult path. After years of training, the most promising potential Mystics go on a pilgrimage across Voss, visiting holy sites in the dangerous Gormak lands and learning from their elders. Even then, not all potentials succeed. The very few who come into their full power as Mystics return triumphantly to Voss-Ka to be recognized by the Three." />

Fleeing into hyperspace after years of wandering, the Pilgrims at last arrived on Tython. The Jedi, only recently arrived themselves, were astonished that the Pilgrims could stumble upon the secret Jedi homeworld so easily; the Matriarch saw the Pilgrims' discovery of an inhabitable planet as destiny.&#xA;&#xA;Since then, the Pilgrims have done everything possible to make a permanent home of Tython, building their community and creating new traditions.

This attack devastated the planet's primary military forces and central government, leaving a unified response nearly impossible.&#xA;&#xA;Eventually, the Empire landed a full invasion force. By this time, the Republic had come to Balmorra's aid but was forced to abandon the planet with the Treaty of Coruscant--after which, the Imperial military declared victory and established its headquarters in Sobrik.

Different sections of the prison and different types of responses are controlled by entirely separate computer systems. This ensures that damage or corruption to one system cannot compromise the entire prison, but it also makes untangling errors difficult at best.&#xA;&#xA;Some of Belsavis's security systems are even tied into rumored alien technology in the deep levels of the prison; this allows them to access systems of unusual power, but also causes occasional eccentricities when outside protocols override modern programming.

Before the bombardment, Ark Brell set up several water purification and waste disposal plants on Taris, with the aim of turning the waste from Taris's factories into alternative fuel sources and minimizing the waste produced by the massive city-world.&#xA;&#xA;Legend has it that the collapse of one of his factories during the bombardment created the acid lake, although present rumor suggests that other, less well-intentioned groups on Taris may be the cause.

    <Body Value="Kolto is a medicinal fluid found naturally on the planet Manaan. Highly valued for its ability to heal, kolto can be found in use in hospitals, clinics and medical bays throughout the galaxy. It also has obvious applications for military use, helping soldiers to recover more quickly from wounds sustained in the throes of war.&#xA;&#xA;The Selkath of Manaan strictly regulate the trade of their monopolistic supply of kolto. For this reason, many Republic and Imperial scientists have attempted to synthesize kolto. While a few less reliable, less stable caches of lab-procured kolto do exist, they are poor substitutes for the real thing." />

Each is among the most powerful Sith in the galaxy; to hold a seat on the council is the highest honor and the greatest position of influence a Sith can attain.&#xA;&#xA;The individual members of the Dark Council control their own spheres of influence and pyramids of subordinate Sith--overall Imperial military strategy falls in the hands of one Dark Council member, while study of ancient artifacts falls into the hands of another. These spheres occasionally overlap, leading to conflict. However, every Sith Lord and apprentice is ultimately answerable to the council member at the top of his or her pyramid. Similarly, non-Sith organizations are usually clearly answerable to one Dark Council member or another.&#xA;&#xA;Meetings of the Dark Council are normally held in the Citadel on Dromund Kaas or in the Sith Academy on Korriban. It's rare for all members to gather at once--power plays among members are frequent, and several of the Dark Lords are virtual hermits. On the occasions when the Emperor summons them, however, all members of the Dark Council are expected to gather and obey." />

Their huts are typically built from bark, roots, branches and cereal stalks. They are far more durable than appears at first glance, as each hut is constructed with its specific location in mind to best withstand local atmospheric patterns and phenomena. A more recent addition to their villages are wooden bridges, which have been added for the convenience of non-Rishii guests." />

The preferred means of learning the route required Force sensitivity and became the first trial of many an aspiring Jedi. But warfare with the Sith under the fallen Jedi Exar Kun led to the destruction of the training grounds, and in the centuries since, Ilum has been home to only a select few.&#xA;&#xA;The temple became a place for young Jedi to travel and build their lightsabers, and where they might meditate in silence.

The term &quot;Sith pureblood&quot; is now used to distinguish between those descended from the species and the order itself.&#xA;&#xA;The Sith species was discovered three thousand years ago on Korriban by exiled human Dark Jedi fleeing Republic space after their defeat in a war called the Second Great Schism. The Dark Jedi quickly enslaved the primitive culture, and over many generations, the two groups intermingled.&#xA;&#xA;Eventually, the elite ruling class of Korriban consisted almost exclusively of the hybridized offspring of the Dark Jedi and the high priests of the Sith people. These offspring tended to exhibit the physical characteristics of their Sith parentage, such as red skin, yellow eyes, bony protrusions on the face or head, and fleshy tendrils dangling from the cheeks and chin. For a brief time, Sith blood was seen as a sign of weakness--but the modern Empire believes purity of heritage carries the strength of the Force.&#xA;&#xA;Genetically speaking, true &quot;pureblood&quot; Sith are virtually extinct, but red skin is still the mark of an Imperial--almost always a Force user--who can trace his or her ancestry into antiquity." />

One of the resulting projects was Hammer Station, a prototype mobile facility built around a combined tractor beam and massive gravity cannon. The tractor beam captured nearby asteroids, and the cannon launched the asteroids at near-relativistic speeds at a chosen target. No shield could handle that magnitude of kinetic energy. When positioned over a planet, Hammer Station was capable of devastating entire cities in a single shot.&#xA;&#xA;However, Hammer Station's attacks could not be tempered. The asteroids caused planet-wide dust clouds and groundquakes, rendering entire worlds nearly uninhabitable. After seeing the destruction, the Republic Senate could not authorize its use, even against the Empire, and ordered the project scrapped.  The Hammer Station project files were classified and later destroyed in a Senate tower bombing after the Treaty of Coruscant was signed. &#xA;" />

    <Body Value="One of the goals of the Jedi Order is to foster greater understanding among the species of the galaxy. To that end, Jedi sometimes leave the order and live as part of another culture, often for years at a time, to learn its customs and study its languages. This cultural immersion follows a key tenet of Jedi diplomatic policy: To be reasonable, one must see all points of view.&#xA;&#xA;Such immersion carries its dangers. Some Jedi have lost their lives undergoing rites of passage or by accidentally offending a rigidly polite alien society. The Jedi Order looks on these losses somberly as hard-earned lessons. However, most Jedi return with new skills and a fresh perspective on life. A few bring unusual habits or tastes, as well; after decades living in a Kubaz hive, for example, Master Arjur developed a craving for dried moon moths." />

Industrial pollution had irreparably damaged the oceans, and chemicals and toxins poisoned the undercity's foundation. When the sprawling metropolis was reduced to rubble, countless pollutants were released into an already tainted ecosystem.&#xA;&#xA;But this was not the end for Taris. For hundreds of years, the planet went without sentient interference, and the ecosystem began to adapt and thrive. Rich vegetation grew within the ruins, scaling steel towers and thrusting aside fallen skyscrapers. Animals--some native to the planet, some pets and lab specimens that had survived the bombardment--bred and repopulated the developing jungles.&#xA;&#xA;Of course, some areas remain too polluted to inhabit--acidic lakes and radioactive sinkholes--but for the most part, Taris is an environmental success story and an object of fascination for scientists. The largest black mark remains the rakghoul plague, and the fear that it may one day spread to Taris's animal population." />

The origin of the syndicate's name is unclear, but a common phrase among despairing Coruscant citizens was &quot;better a black sun than none.&quot; Alas, hopes that Black Sun would bring order instead of anarchy died quickly.&#xA;&#xA;For Black Sun, the rioting and looting never really stopped. Although the gangsters have profitable spice- and weapons-trafficking operations, their members, almost to a man, have an extraordinary taste for violence. Civilians are extorted until they have nothing left to extort; afterwards, they're used for target practice. City blocks are incinerated for the pleasure of demolitionists.&#xA;&#xA;Despite the efforts of the Justicars' Brigade, Black Sun has become a force to be reckoned with.

    <Body Value="Around the time of the foundation of the Republic, a group of Duros explorers led by Chal Haan colonized the planet Neimoidia. Over millennia, the conditions of their new colony led these Duros to evolve into a separate species: Neimoidians. These green-skinned, red-eyed beings grow from grubs in communal hives, where they spend the early years of their lives competing for food. Those who cannot find or steal enough to eat quickly starve, a process which ensures that weakness is weeded out early.&#xA;&#xA;Personal greed is seen as acceptable and even desirable in Neimoidian culture, and while Neimoidians are known as capable entrepreneurs and administrators, their opponents paint them as deceitful, lazy cowards. Neimoidians do rely heavily on advanced droids for all but the most important tasks--freeing them to pursue elaborate political games for social rank or increased profits--but Neimoidian investors have also aided the Republic's economy in hard times. The Senate therefore tolerates Neimoidian bribe-taking and backroom trading... up to a point." />

This arrangement allows the Three Families to carefully guard the secret of adrenal creation, and it has made them incredibly wealthy.

    <Body Value="Like many great scientific advances, Quesh venom's immense value was discovered by chance. After its initial discovery, the planet Quesh was dismissed as a toxic wasteland. Orbital chemical scans languished in a file for decades until they were unearthed by a junior Republic chemist named Bardian Aelto. After working briefly on adrenal research projects, Aelto had been assigned to review planets likely to be classified as uninhabitable.&#xA;&#xA;When Aelto studied Quesh's chemical scans, he was surprised to recognize a molecule chain from his work on adrenal stimulants. Quesh's atmosphere had properties almost identical to &quot;Hutt venom&quot;, the primary ingredient in the galaxy's most high-grade adrenals. Aelto realized a relatively simple chemical process could convert this &quot;Quesh venom&quot; into a usable--and exceptionally valuable--compound. Thanks to one late-night session in a Coruscant laboratory, Quesh had become one of the Republic's most valued resource worlds. &#xA;" />

Recognizing the value in overcoming the travel and communications problems that plagued Makeb due to its notoriously harsh atmosphere, GSI researchers attempted to manipulate particle beams fired from orbit in such a way that they would counteract the effects. However, when driven through the atmosphere the particles took on exotic attributes that made them energy rich and malleable. While these new properties had no effect on starships or holotransmissions, they were found to be beneficial to living beings.&#xA;&#xA;When signaled from the ground, the SSS bathes its target in Orbital Flux and the satellite enters Support Mode, continuously tracking the target's condition and location, and even providing medical probe assistance. While Orbital Flux only works on Makeb at present, GSI's technicians are striving to replicate the curious process without the help of Makeb's atmosphere." />

Queen Amanoa was actually a descendant of Freedon Nadd, strong in the dark side, and the Jedi were among her enemies.&#xA;&#xA;The queen's forces battled with those of the Beast Riders and the Jedi. Cay Qel-Droma lost his arm in the fighting, and only the arrival of Arca Jeth--who used battle meditation to turn the battle in the Jedi's favor--saved Onderon.

King Bouris Ulgo used his influence to shatter House Teral's trading contacts and forced Teral--never a military house--to raise massive armies to face Ulgo attacks.&#xA;&#xA;Today, harried and nearly bankrupt, House Teral is a shadow of its formerly prosperous self. The last straw was the recent death of its diplomatic delegate. Although officially judged an accident, no one is fooled; it is clear that House Ulgo will be satisfied with nothing less than Teral's utter destruction." />

    <Body Value="There has always been a dual nature to the legend of Revan. At his core, is he truly a Jedi or is he Sith? It has been a hotly debated subject among scholars and politicians for centuries. As one might expect, the conclusions reached by those from Republic-aligned worlds often differ from those of an Imperial bent--but not always.&#xA;&#xA;Some of the most knowledgeable authorities in the ways of the Force believe that it is right to call Revan a Jedi Knight and it is also right to refer to him as Dark Lord of the Sith. They contend that simultaneously knowing and embracing both the light and dark sides of the Force is possible, and point to Revan as potential proof. However, many of these same authorities also believe that such divided adherence would lead unquestionably to madness." />

These preliminary results match anecdotal experience--SCORPIO places no inherent value on biological or cybernetic life and is interested primarily in self-iteration through rapid experience.

Vicious and ill-tempered, they prefer meals of organic debris and runoff--but even lone womp rats will attack any creature that gets too close, often spreading virulent disease.&#xA;&#xA;When found in the desert, womp rats also hunt in packs, emerging from burrows and swarming their unfortunate victims in a flurry of claws and teeth. A dozen womp rats can overwhelm a full-grown dewback in just a few seconds, and larger packs regularly feast on fresh bantha." />

The new design is intended to echo the style of Alderaan's famous castles and to evoke the Jedi virtues of humility, serenity and patience.&#xA;&#xA;Construction began a year after the Jedi made a permanent settlement on Tython and took three years to complete using local Tythonian stone and timber. The temple's site, built upon the ruins of a much older temple, was chosen by the Jedi Council after a week of fasting and meditation. While the temple's formidable technological defenses are concealed and integrated into the architecture, it's the presence of the Council and the Jedi who train there who truly ensure its safety from invaders." />

Surrounded by ardent supporters and loyal political allies, she delivered an impassioned speech on the steps of the Senate tower calling for the eradication of the Sith Empire.

It has seen and survived dozens of wars, suffered under the control of alien species, served as the capital of the Republic and--according to common wisdom--ushered in the birth of the human species.&#xA;&#xA;In ancient times, before the planet became a city, Coruscant was a world covered mainly in oceans. Over millennia, humans spread out over the land masses, covering them with structures--and as technology developed and overpopulation grew more troublesome, the Coruscanti people sought ways to house their ever-growing numbers. Eventually, the seas themselves were drained, and the humans spread into the empty basins.&#xA;&#xA;It has been over 100,000 years since sunlight last reached the lowest levels of the city. Now, Coruscant stands as a marvel of engineering and sentient triumph, home to thousands of species and countless billions of individuals. Archaeologists spend their whole lives descending through the city's layers, searching for answers about its distant past, and no one in the universe knows Coruscant's full story. " />

The last uncontested ruler of Alderaan was a proud Panteer queen who had earned the respect--if not always the love--of both friends and adversaries.&#xA;&#xA;When Bouris Ulgo declared himself king, House Panteer immediately challenged his rule. Ulgo responded by burning the Panteer estates to the ground and forcing the survivors into hiding, bringing the family low after millennia.

Most of these explorers are simply never seen again; the rest are left to wander the forests, broken and mad. The Nightmare Lands are a blight on Voss; unfortunately, they are a blight nobody seems able to cure." />

At the Draay mansion, Carrick discovered the real culprit: Krynda's aide Haazen, a fallen Jedi who had been manipulating the Covenant. As Lucien and Carrick dueled, Haazen used an override in the Republic Navy's weapon systems, intending to destroy the Jedi Temple and the Council. &#xA;&#xA;At the last minute, Lucien overcame his anger, helped Carrick escape, then used Haazen's override to bombard Haazen's position instead. Haazen was killed; Lucien survived, suffering serious injuries. Zayne Carrick's name was cleared, and the Jedi Covenant was finished." />

However, eliminating Black Sun and regaining control proved more difficult than the Justicars had expected.

Through political maneuvering, the members conspired to have Chancellor Pers'lya impeached and their own man, Senator Contispex, put in his place. Through Supreme Chancellor Contispex, Pius Dea exploited tensions within the Hutt Empire after the Hutt Cataclysms. Eventually Contispex sanctioned an invasion of Hutt Space, beginning the Pius Dea Crusades.&#xA;&#xA;Over the next thousand years, Contispex's descendants--biological and ideological--would inherit his position, continuing to wage war against various alien factions until growing unrest brought Pius Dea's rule to an end.

As the summit began, Imperial forces launched a surprise attack on Coruscant, the Republic capital. Conquering the city-world was impossible, but the Empire wreaked enormous havoc in a short period, effectively holding Coruscant hostage and forcing the Republic to agree to less-than-favorable terms." />

    <Body Value="Name: Eckard Lokin (unconfirmed)&#xA;Gender: Male&#xA;Species: Human&#xA;Age: 65 (estimate)&#xA;Likes: Clever solutions, long-term thinking, technology, pragmatism&#xA;Dislikes: Ideology, honesty, selfish actions without clear long-term gain&#xA;&#xA;Primary Stat: Cunning&#xA;Secondary Stat: Endurance&#xA;&#xA;Primary Weapon: Blaster Pistol&#xA;Secondary Weapon: Vibroknife&#xA;&#xA;Personal History: Age and surname suggest Lokin was born on Dromund Kaas during the pre-war years. Files acquired during Operation: Freefall reference a &quot;Doctor E. Lokin&quot; working as Science and Medical Advisor to Kaas City military police during this period, but no visual is provided.&#xA;&#xA;First confirmed sighting was during the boarding of Imperial dreadnought Warhammer--Lokin was one of the two individuals aboard who evaded capture. Interestingly, he was not listed in the crew roster. First identification as Fixer Fifteen came during Operation: Red Cell (see listening post transcripts). Additional sightings and references to the Fixer Fifteen designation uncovered intermittently since.&#xA;&#xA;Analysis: Take a close look at the operations where we caught Lokin, and you'll notice a pattern--every time he turns up, something big is happening and we can't figure the role he's playing. He's professional, he knows his science and he's sneaky. We know he rubs some of his colleagues the wrong way, but even his fellow agents haven't given us anything useful under questioning.&#xA;&#xA;Note by Harson Nild, Director of Core World Operations: Is Lokin still in active service? I remember hearing about a Fixer biologist back in the day, but thought he'd retired years ago.&#xA;" />

Having re-established the Empire there, he slowly withdrew from public life, leaving the Empire's administration to his Dark Council.&#xA;&#xA;At first the Dark Council was subservient to the Emperor. But as centuries passed and the Emperor remained withdrawn, the Dark Council became more independent, believing he was weakening. When the council discovered the Emperor was planning to invade the Republic, there was angry dissent. Naga Sadow's failed invasion of the Republic a millennium before had almost destroyed the Empire; some believed it would be madness to repeat his mistake.&#xA;&#xA;Several of the Dark Council's members decided to depose the Emperor before he led them to destruction. But the Emperor learned of their intentions and the entire Dark Council, loyalists and dissenters alike, was purged. The price of disobedience made clear, a new council was chosen and the Emperor's plans proceeded." />

Imperial scientists have adapted the Desolator technology into a new form: the Firestorm Turbolaser. These cannons superheat the atmosphere in a targeted area, literally setting the air on fire and incinerating anyone unfortunate enough to be caught within the area of effect.&#xA;&#xA;The Firestorm Turbolasers have one key weakness: they must be deployed relatively close to the battlefield. This leaves the artillery units vulnerable to counterattack and destruction. Indeed, the only way to remain safe from these deadly weapons is to ensure they are never fired." />

There are numerous hypergates scattered around Gree Enclave space, in varying sizes and states of functionality.&#xA;&#xA;Hypergates resemble freestanding doors or archways. Anyone who steps through an activated hypergate is instantly transported through hyperspace to an opposite hypergate somewhere else. Some hypergates simply move a traveler to a different continent on the same planet, but rumors persist of hypergates capable of sending whole vessels across the galaxy.&#xA;&#xA;Gree culture reveres hypergates as sacred technological works of art. The Enclave's leaders have long maintained that only elite members of the Operator caste known as &quot;gatemasters&quot; know how to activate hypergates.

They live in nomadic clans each ruled by a female shaman, and there is surprisingly little rivalry between the clans, as each limits scavenging to its traditional territory. Necessities not found or built by the clan are purchased from offworlders' settlements, where Jawas' skills as tinkerers whose work endures the desert heat are reluctantly valued.&#xA;&#xA;Annually, all the clans gather in the basin of the Dune Sea to exchange goods and share ideas. This is also a common time for clans to exchange sons and daughters of age. This practice increases genetic diversity within each clan and solidifies the unspoken alliance among the Jawas as a whole." />

He solidified his title as the galaxy's greatest gladiator when he defeated notorious Wookiee-hunter Karssk on Ord Mantell. The more gullible underworld scum whisper that Bowdaar is an immortal creature who can't be killed, but those who have faced him and lived know that he is simply the best there is. &#xA;&#xA;On the surface, Bowdaar may seem like a simple-minded brute, but nothing could be further from the truth. Case in point: Bowdaar eventually discovered the identity of the Trandoshans who first captured and enslaved him. One night in an arena on Loovria, Bowdaar learned that his former captors were sitting in the stands. An unfortunate &quot;weapons malfunction&quot; caused the drunken Trandoshan slavers to meet an untimely--and extremely messy--end.&#xA;&#xA;Likes: A good fight against worthy foes, protecting the weak, personal honor&#xA;Dislikes: Cruelty, bullying, slavery, respecting authority that's in the wrong&#xA;&#xA;Primary Stat: Strength&#xA;Secondary Stat: Endurance&#xA;&#xA;Primary Weapon: Vibrosword&#xA;Secondary Weapon: Shield Generator" />

These &quot;raklings&quot; appear to have been formed from luminescent spore sacs strung along the rakghoul tunnels, though it is not yet clear to biologists how this process works. They have learned, however, that the raklings are attracted to a particular pheromone emitted from certain flora found within the tunnels. Researchers have long wished to use this pheromone to lure raklings into captivity, but strict antiviral protocols enacted by THORN do not allow these proto-rakghouls to be taken aboveground. Until they can be tested in a proper laboratory setting, the truth of how rakghouls self-multiply may not be fully understood." />

The old Jedi Council chamber is the only room left largely intact, but it is still considered dangerous and prone to collapse.&#xA;&#xA;The temple ruins have continued to see strife even after the Sacking of Coruscant. They were the site of a duel between Darth Malgus and the Jedi empath Aryn Leneer before Imperial forces were withdrawn from the planet.

When the Hutts discovered Evocar--the planet that would become Hutta--they bartered with each tribe individually, offering wondrous technology in exchange for land until they effectively owned the entire planet. Those Evocii who had refused to sell their freedom were herded onto ships and relocated to Nar Shaddaa, where they were kept as a ready source of cheap labor.&#xA;&#xA;The Hutts' dominion over the Evocii continued unchallenged for centuries until a charismatic Evocii named Ejal led an uprising against the Hutts. Ejal's revolt gained unprecedented momentum until he was betrayed by one of his tribesmen and delivered to his foes. Ejal met a gruesome end while the traitor was awarded his freedom and showered with riches. Even today, the Hutts are fond of this tale, as it reminds the Evocii of the rewards for obedience... and the price of defiance. " />

Ilum's unknown location and hard-to-navigate hyperspace lanes made it ideal for hiding important assets and launching sneak attacks, though its primary value was in providing lightsaber crystals for the suddenly militarized Jedi. As Ilum's military value increased, so did the size of its landing zones.&#xA;&#xA;Now that the Empire has come to Ilum, the landing zone has become a fortified complex of considerable dimensions and a vital target for Imperial attacks." />

Twi'leks are native to the harsh world of Ryloth, a planet that has suffered from occupation by the Hutt Cartel in recent years; Twi'leks on Ryloth not forced to work in the mines are often taken as slaves, exported to markets throughout the Outer Rim.&#xA;&#xA;Millennia of dispersion into the wider galaxy, however, means that many Twi'leks have little or no sense of connection with their beleaguered homeworld; Twi'leks may be second only to humans in their ubiquity throughout known space. Nonetheless, many Twi'leks can't escape the shadows of slavery and the underworld--often, they find work with the same pirates, slavers and spice dealers who have traditionally oppressed their species.&#xA;&#xA;Twi'lek names vary dramatically, depending on whether the parents follow the old Twi'lek tradition of combining given and family name, or use the more common approach (separating first name and surname) used by many other species.

This position gives the separatists multiple access points to the island's settlements, as well as a predator's eye view of Fort Garnik itself.&#xA;&#xA;Sources indicate the volcano base originally belonged to a notorious gangster known only as &quot;the Corellian&quot; who disappeared in the civil war's early years. Whether the Corellian joined the separatists or gave them his volcano base under duress is anyone's guess. Regardless, taking out the separatist stronghold has proven almost impossible. Any attack on foot exposes the invading force to withering counterattacks and heavy casualties, but artillery strikes on the volcano risk flooding the entire island with lava." />

That all changed when the Empire invaded Alderaan; the Sith Lord Darth Malgus led the attack, timing his invasion with a feint that drew the Republic's fleet light years away. &#xA;&#xA;Unknown to Malgus, a small contingent of Republic soldiers was stationed on Alderaan. The soldiers were outnumbered and disorganized, but among them were the members of Havoc Squad, the Republic's most decorated military unit. Under the leadership of Captain Jace Malcom, the Havoc Squad commandos rallied the Republic troops and waged a fierce guerrilla campaign against the Empire.&#xA;&#xA;The resistance fighters harried the Imperial forces constantly, delaying their advance long enough for the Republic fleet to race back and repel the invasion. In the end, Darth Malgus was defeated and the Empire was driven from Alderaan. The victory was a costly one, though; Alderaan would not soon forget the devastation." />

Does he intend to preserve any followers, or live on alone? With such unlimited power, could he plant the seeds of life and raise a new galaxy from the old one's ashes?" />

The Corellia system, for example, appears to have been artificially constructed.&#xA;&#xA;These claims would seem extraordinary, but many of the Architects' machines survived the ages. The Vultar system was home to an immense &quot;Cosmic Turbine&quot; that could only have been Architect technology, before misuse destroyed both the turbine and the Vultar system itself. The fabled Centerpoint Station is thought to be an Architect installation, though many species have claimed it as the work of their own people.&#xA;&#xA;In addition to their engineering marvels, it is believed that the Architects seeded the Core Worlds with life--particularly humans--though some attribute this to the Rakata's Infinite Empire.

    <Body Value="Most creatures avoid Hutta's polluted swamps, but these massive reptiles call the toxic marshes home. Nicknamed &quot;chemilizards&quot; by the local workers, these predators have adapted to the poisonous land by absorbing toxins, which contribute to their unique coloring and acidic saliva. Many also believe these toxins have poisoned the chemilizards' minds, turning the ferocious reptiles violent and untamable.&#xA;&#xA;Before their mutation, chemilizards were a Hutt delicacy known as orpali dragons. These rare lizards were bred for harvest, killed in infancy and traditionally served over a bed of glazed chuba eyes. Orpali dragons were on the menu for the centennial feast of Bakuush the Hutt when several hatchlings escaped into the wild through the palace sewers. Over time, the resilient lizards evolved, and although one Hutt did attempt to dine on the adapted chemilizards, the results were most unappetizing." />

    <Body Value="Behind the Sith and the powerful Imperial military is the vast network of agents, information gatherers, deception specialists and strategists that makes up Imperial Intelligence. Part spy organization, part secret police, Imperial Intelligence handles all of the Empire's covert operations--guarding the Empire's secrets, acquiring valuable intel from the Republic, hunting down traitors and cleaning up messes created by unhinged Sith Lords.&#xA;&#xA;Imperial Intelligence reports to the Minister of Intelligence, who in turn reports directly to the Dark Council. Not a military organization, Imperial Intelligence officers are nonetheless viewed with respect by military and civilian personnel--it's Intelligence that can judge a person as loyal or traitorous, arrange the advancement of a career or the blacklisting of a powerful leader.&#xA;&#xA;A place in Imperial Intelligence is a coveted rank, reserved for some of the best of the Empire's non-Force sensitive subjects. In some cases, officers are &quot;poached&quot; by Sith Lords seeking to build their own specialized intelligence networks; for the most part, however, Intelligence personnel go unnoticed by anyone outside the organization. The best agents are the ones no one's ever heard of." />

A Selkath experimenting with cybernetic applications using Rakatan technology was one of those looking to harness the Star Forge's immeasurable power. With the shipyard's self-replicating properties, the Selkath theorized implementation of its parts could allow his test subjects to survive the grafting process, and to achieve virtual immortality. When the Order of Revan made a piece of the Star Forge available to him, the Selkath was able to prove his theories and the Infinite Army was born.&#xA;&#xA;This is not the first time the notion of an Infinite Army was conceived. A tormented Jedi looking to destroy the Sith Emperor once appropriated a long-abandoned Rakata foundry built into an asteroid.

The Jedi entity's manner of speaking and some of her references to historical events, however, suggest that she served as a general in the Jedi Civil War.

Fear turned to betrayal, but Renge's plot did not escape the Emperor's notice. As punishment, the executioner's blade was turned on its owner. Renge resisted, but the blade struck true and broke off in his chest.&#xA;&#xA;Renge was not permitted the escape of death. His wounds were healed, and the tainted splinter of his blade remained buried inside him.

Temple could be a plant, but it's just as likely she's been intentionally forced out of the picture.

Hallow Voice appealed to the Rakata to spare his people. The Rakata strung out negotiations until they were confident they had the Esh-kha contained, then captured Hallow Voice. Millennia of imprisonment on Belsavis have not made him bitter; rather, Hallow Voice is more devoted than ever to a spirit of cooperation and to calming the murderous instincts of his cousin Esh-kha." />

    <Body Value="Carbonite is a metal alloy that, when mixed with various gasses, can be used to flash freeze blocks of cargo for transportation or storage. Its use in freezing living creatures is relatively new in the galaxy and considered highly dangerous--subjects frozen for more than a few hours have a very low survival rate unless the carbonite is prepared with much expense at an elaborate facility. Even in the best cases, the sudden shock of flash freezing (often combined with a lack of life-support monitoring during suspension) tends to make the process extremely traumatic--sometimes even turning fatal hours after a subject has been thawed.&#xA;&#xA;Still, a quick carbonite spray is the only known technique for freezing living creatures quickly and with minimal preparation. The technology is growing increasingly popular with bounty hunters and smugglers; as a result, many bounty hunting guilds have clauses in their contracts mandating live capture payment even if the bounty fails to survive the post-hibernation period." />

When a group of Blades finally decided it was time to test the resolve of the native Rishii by raiding their villages, Arankau was ready with an ambush. Dozens of Rishii led by Arankau severely wounded every Nova Blade in sight--but left not one of them dead. It was the last time outsiders ever sought to cross the Rishii. It also marked the only time Arankau has ever had to fight." />

It is not typical, therefore, for Kaleesh to sell themselves as mercenaries, as doing so is often viewed as dishonorable.&#xA;&#xA;With the outbreak of the latest war between the Republic and Empire, however, mercenary work has become too plentiful for the Kaleesh to ignore. Many clans of Kaleesh have formed armies-for-hire, throwing their lot in with the alien-friendly Republic--and charging a high price. Still, the Republic's way of waging war leaves little room for the valiant acts of heroism that form the backbone of Kaleesh religion, and it seems likely that should the Empire move beyond its alien prejudices, the Kaleesh might be persuaded to switch sides." />

The men who truly matter are behind the scenes. Beginning with the capture of Republic SIS agents in the Outer Rim and culminating in the circumspect cultivation of greedy Senators through proxies, Darth Baras has spent vast resources patiently piecing together information on the Republic's greatest--and most elusive--generals. &#xA;&#xA;Although Plan Zero was composed at Darth Vengean's directive, it was Baras who has spent almost a decade readying it in secret.

    <Body Value="The common Tatooine name for a condition seen on many desert worlds, Sand Rot is a sickness developed after spending long periods of time in the deep desert. Sufferers develop a distinctive cough and begin to lose feeling in their hands and fingers. Sand Rot is treatable, preferably by taking the sufferer offworld, but few on Tatooine can afford the expense. &#xA;&#xA;Many have wondered if Tatooine's native Sand People can catch the Sand Rot, as they never leave the desert wastes. Although it is difficult to know for certain, some desert guides believe the Sand People's distinctive masks and wrappings protect against the sickness and will pay good credits for intact garb." />

Some believe it is the residual dark energy of the ancient Sith species, while others insist the canyon serves as a focal point for the combined hatred and strength of the entombed Dark Lords. Some even hope the madness is caused by an artifact buried beneath the sands, waiting for a Sith to claim its power" />

With no way off the planet, the Nova Blades took to making a home for themselves on Rishi. By the time the Nova Blades learned to refine Rishi's abundant fossil fuels and return to the stars, it was not to escape but to send out invitations to like-minded gangs and individuals. Their offer: come with us to a lush oasis far away from galactic governance. Unsurprisingly, not a single invitee turned them down." />

    <Body Value="From the journal of Jedi Master Arlo Grennen during his investigation into the dark side's influence on Yavin 4:&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Just as Naga Sadow trained his eventual replacement, so did Freedon Nadd's spirit find a powerful apprentice in Exar Kun. And just as Nadd killed his lord Sadow, Kun destroyed Nadd's spirit here on Yavin 4. These notable deaths likely served to further imbue the moon's temples with dark power, further fueling the barbaric Massassi--as well as the succession of Dark Lords who would later reside here.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;I think Kun saw what Naga Sadow had accomplished here with Sith alchemy and architecture and decided he could do better. He forced the Massassi to build new temples, but this time with a focus on complementing and augmenting the dark side. Kun even went so far as to use various technologies to manipulate the Force in ways that I can't say I understand. I can't, but I would like to....&quot;" />

That's one of the many things I hope to learn while I'm here.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Sadow was a gifted alchemist who turned his Massassi followers into powerful, violent animals who worshipped and served Sadow. The Massassi built massive temples for Sadow where they sacrificed their own in his honor. Sadow was even powerful enough to stave off the inevitable.

Chartered and overseen by the Galactic Senate, the SIS is responsible for information gathering and covert operations both inside and out of Republic space, as well as for assisting the military, local law enforcement and the Jedi Order.&#xA;&#xA;The SIS is the latest in a long line of Republic espionage agencies founded and disbanded over the centuries. Originally a monitoring and decryption arm of the Senate library, the SIS rapidly expanded during the war against the Empire. It remains smaller, more focused and comparatively underfunded in comparison to Imperial Intelligence, but has proven its effectiveness many times over.&#xA;&#xA;Although by no means a secret organization, the SIS keeps a relatively low profile. SIS operations are rarely revealed, and its administrators almost never appear alongside Senators or other officials. This is a public relations gambit--the SIS believes that the Republic citizenry would be uncomfortable with the nature of its work, and so avoids attracting attention and unwanted questions." />

However, during one Great Hunt, the Mandalorians were surprised to see a droid among the competitors--an utterly unprecedented event.&#xA;&#xA;After questioning the droid--an obsolete construction model--the Huntmaster overrode objections from conservative hunters and allowed its entry. The nameless droid proceeded to outwit and out-gun its way to victory in the Great Hunt.&#xA;&#xA;When the droid returned to claim its title as champion, more arguments ensued. Ression Trana, a prominent clan leader, claimed loudly that a droid champion mocked Mandalorian traditions. The droid listened patiently until Trana accused it of being a proxy for a cowardly hunter. Without hesitation, the droid kicked Ression Trana, mid-sentence, through a window. In the aftermath, the droid earned not only the title of Grand Champion, but also its nickname: &quot;the Defenestrator&quot;." />

If the vessel has passengers, the boarding team may take hostages to force the crew to surrender.

A deadly remnant of Tython's mysterious past, the original purpose of the droids has been lost in the mists of time.  Some speculate they were once guardians, programmed to protect the powerful secrets of Tython's original Jedi inhabitants. Others believe the droids were used for combat training by the order shortly after the creation of the first proto-lightsaber. A more sinister theory suggests the droids were somehow involved in the destruction of Kaleth itself. Whatever the explanation, one fact is not in dispute: The droids will attack any living creature that dares to enter the territory they still fiercely patrol. " />

They joined forces with an elite Republic Special Forces unit, who stole the security codes for the Dread Masters' heavily-guarded dreadnaught. Hijacking an Imperial Moff's personal yacht, a Republic strike team boarded the dreadnaught and, aided by Jedi Master Jaric Kaedan, captured the Dread Masters. The dreadnaught was rigged for self-destruct to cover the strike team's escape.&#xA;&#xA;The Republic officially announced that the Dread Masters had been killed, even as the Jedi secretly arranged their imprisonment on Belsavis.

They are deeply respectful of others and expect to be treated in kind. The Drall are not a violent species and possess little military training, but their detailed knowledge of Corellia is proving invaluable to Republic forces." />

This new patriarch, Hallow Voice, also had peculiar new ideas of how the Esh-kha should cooperate with other species.&#xA;&#xA;The Esh-kha realized their group had grown too large and needed to split. Hallow Voice's birth and his unfamiliar ideas were clearly intended to divide their society and keep it from collapsing. As Esh-kha warriors were born who declared themselves for Hallow Voice, the young patriarch agreed to take his followers away from the main group. They settled on a distant world and began reaching out to nearby cultures. &#xA;&#xA;However, the Esh-kha had become known for violence and mass destruction. Only a few tentative alliances were achieved before the Infinite Empire imprisoned the Esh-kha on Belsavis. Still, Jedi historians now wonder if a particular legend of grey-skinned warriors told in the Outer Rim--once thought to concern the Taung--might be a faint memory of Hallow Voice's followers." />

Some types of spice are primarily medicinal, refined into lifesaving painkillers or used to treat mental illness; more often than not, however, spice traders deal in addictive, recreational chemical compounds with unpredictable and dangerous physical and psychological effects.&#xA;&#xA;Spice is tightly regulated--or completely banned--on most Republic and Imperial worlds. On the Hutt-controlled moon of Nar Shaddaa, however, spice is openly imported, processed, refined and packaged for both local and offworld distribution. Nar Shaddaa's spice trade is split among numerous gangs and petty crime lords who use the profits to fund other, often violent, activities.&#xA;&#xA;In recent years, the Exchange crime syndicate has offered several key players cut-rate distribution of product on Republic worlds through their existing criminal networks. The newly forged alliances have finally given the Exchange a foothold in the spice trade, much to the chagrin of the Hutts." />

However, Jelven Donn was never able to solve the problem of the deep-miners' power consumption, and lost half a dozen units to overloaded batteries.&#xA;&#xA;With the discovery of Ilum and its unique crystal deposits, Jelven Donn realized that the amplifying capabilities of Adegan crystals could make deep-miner power supplies a viable prospect at last. Deep-miners have since become a staple of Imperial mining efforts on Ilum.

    <Body Value="Are droids sentient? If so, should they have the same rights as other sentient beings? Is owning a droid tantamount to owning a slave? These questions have arisen since intelligent droids were first programmed.&#xA;&#xA;In the Empire, where slavery is an accepted part of Imperial culture, the issue of droid rights is meaningless: the only difference between droids and slaves is one of price. The Republic, however, was forced to address this question almost four centuries ago, when demand for a Droid Rights Bill began to gain ground. Attempts to pass the bill ended abruptly with the brief and violent &quot;Great Droid Revolution,&quot; but the questions remain.&#xA;&#xA;The opinions of droids themselves--on those rare occasions when they're asked--are divided. Some accept unquestioningly that being property and serving a master is the natural state of a droid. Other droids--usually those that have been mishandled--claim that devices such as restraining bolts perform the same function as shock collars for organic slaves, and should be just as despised. The fact that droids that do not receive regular memory wipes appear to develop a personality only fuels the ongoing debate." />

Unlike the palace of Nem'ro, Fa'athra's home is a veritable deathtrap--built with warfare and defense as its primary purpose, rather than business and luxury.&#xA;&#xA;Fa'athra employs several different mercenary groups to patrol the palace grounds and corridors. Each mercenary organization is given information only about its own territory and has no information about the rest of the palace's defenses. Fa'athra's paranoia guarantees that no single betrayal can cause his downfall, but it may also be his greatest weakness." />

Although the planet Koros Major was stable, growing wealthy on carbonite exports, the other six worlds of the system were poor and increasingly lawless.&#xA;&#xA;The task of uniting the Koros system was accepted by a noble famed for her military achievements. Empress Teta was the heir to Koros Major and was determined that the rest of the Koros system would share its prosperity.

She was ultimately successful, though she had to fight a long and bloody campaign to conquer the planet Kirrek.&#xA;&#xA;Empress Teta would become known as one of the Republic's boldest commanders.

During the war, the duke was a fierce opponent of the Empire and the Sith who saw his family treated brutally during the Empire's short-lived invasion of Alderaan. This neither soured the duke and his house on peace, nor weakened their resolve to battle evil; when Alderaan's civil war began years later, Organa was among the last houses to take up arms... but the duke had privately trained a talented and honorable battalion for such an eventuality, and readily turned to the Republic for advice and assistance during the crisis.

Therefore, he shall be the first to die.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;It is rumored, however, that Tulak Hord was not so successful at killing his rival as he would have liked--and that the strange events in the Dark Temple on Dromund Kaas have Kallig at their center." />

Typically the scenes depict a vorantikus devouring a Voss Mystic, or laying wasted to the mountaintop city of Voss-Ka itself, though there is no historical account of any such attack upon the Voss capital.&#xA;&#xA;Understanding the vorantikus may be key to understanding the evolutionary &quot;arms race&quot; occurring amongst Voss's fauna. The planet's wildlife is far larger, heartier and more aggressive than that of most comparable worlds, and the vorantikus represents an amazingly precise set of &quot;alpha predator&quot; traits. What sort of environment--or unnatural intervention--creates a vorantikus, and what effect does such a creature have on the world around it?" />

In effect, the subject is programmed to react to a keyword with total obedience. Long-term commands can be implanted, but with lowered effectiveness. Once programming is activated, the subject will be aware of his inability to control his actions but unable to revolt.&#xA;&#xA;Procedure: Subject must first be primed with a dosage of the IX serum; the serum can be applied to the subject discreetly (e.g., during a routine medcenter visit) but should be formulated based on a detailed accounting of physical and psychological factors.&#xA;&#xA;The serum circulates over a period of between three and thirty days, effectively altering the subject's brain chemistry. Once the serum is fully absorbed and the subject is primed, subject must be imprinted over the course of several hours. A trained handler will designate a permanent keyword that will activate the subject's programming and open him to commands. Long-term commands, if desired, can be implemented at this time.&#xA;&#xA;No way to reverse the treatment has been developed. Theoretically, one could repeat the cycle and apply a new keyword--overwriting old programming--but the physical side effects of repeated IX serum usage could prove inhibiting.&#xA;&#xA;Notes: The Minister of Intelligence disapproves of widespread use of Castellan restraints on Imperial Intelligence personnel, but has agreed that limited trials are appropriate.&#xA;&#xA;Cross-reference: SLV serum series, IX serum, Quesh, dimalium-6" />

In the confusion of the battle, Jori Daragon fled back to the Republic, not realizing her ship carried a homing beacon for the Sith to follow." />

Three centuries ago, a pair of idealistic young Jedi named Revan and Malak led thousands of followers into the Outer Rim to do battle with an invading Mandalorian army. The Mandalorians were defeated--and Revan and Malak returned to the Republic not as heroes, but as conquerors.&#xA;&#xA;Declaring themselves Dark Lords of the Sith, Darth Revan and Darth Malak began the ruthless subjugation of Republic worlds in the Outer Rim. The Jedi Council, which had been loath to take action against the Mandalorians, assembled an army to bring the traitors to justice. Darth Revan was captured during an attack by the Jedi Knight Bastila Shan and eventually turned back to the light side. Together Revan and Bastila defeated Malak, ending the threat. " />

With a trail unwittingly laid by the hyperspace explorer Jori Daragon, Sith Lord Naga Sadow saw a chance for revenge and to expand the borders of the Sith Empire. He had tricked the Sith Council into believing the Republic was about to attack and united several Sith factions into a massive invasion fleet. &#xA;&#xA;Meanwhile, Jori Daragon had done her best to warn the Republic of an impending Sith invasion, but only the warlord Empress Teta believed her. Teta was still gathering her armies when Sadow's entire fleet arrived in the Koros system and opened fire.&#xA;&#xA;Jedi and Republic forces rallied quickly, but strengthened by Sith sorcery, Sadow's attacks were unpredictable and devastating. The conflict quickly spread throughout the galaxy, until even Coruscant was threatened. The Great Hyperspace War became the first conflict on a truly galactic scale." />

These sites were then furnished with heavy defenses, armaments and elite Republic troops.

The number and locations of the Guardian Holds is a closely-guarded secret held by the Republic's military leaders and the Jedi Council.&#xA;&#xA;Some have questioned why so much expense has been invested specifically in protecting Corellia.

Every few hundred years, these Killiks would emerge and come into conflict with the colonists before retreating and sleeping once again. The Alderaanians viewed the Killiks as monsters out of legend, and no one's certain how the Killiks view the Alderaanians.&#xA;&#xA;Killik society is comprised of a collection of hive minds--some violently territorial, others gentle and reclusive. Individual Killiks possess no sense of identity or self, and each would unquestioningly sacrifice its life for the benefit of its nest. As a result, Killiks cannot comprehend the value other species place on individuals, making them difficult to interact or negotiate with. They do, however, have values of their own, creating beautiful works of art and engaging in complex ritual behavior.&#xA;&#xA;The strength of the Killik hive mind is such that it can even absorb individuals from other species, altering their brain chemistry so that they respond to the will of the nest.

Other sources attribute their creation directly to the Sith Lord Exar Kun, who performed many Force experiments on creatures on Yavin Four. Terentateks are undoubtedly one of the most vicious of all creatures steeped in the dark side, and they are doubly dangerous because of their unnatural resistance to Force powers.&#xA;&#xA;Jedi throughout the ages have tried to wipe terentateks from the galaxy, but the creatures have proven incredibly resilient. The most recent concerted effort was three centuries ago; many terentateks were destroyed, but the hunt took the lives of many Jedi Masters, as well.&#xA;" />

Although the Republic was suspicious, the war had stretched its capabilities and resources to a breaking point. Peace seemed the only hope of survival. &#xA;&#xA;Diplomats from both sides traveled to Alderaan to discuss the treaty, but the Empire was already making its move. An Imperial fleet descended on Coruscant and launched a massive orbital bombardment against the city. As the Sith Lord Darth Malgus marched into the Jedi Temple, other Imperial forces captured the Senate tower. The entire planet was effectively held hostage.&#xA;&#xA;Knowing that &quot;peace negotiations&quot; were over, the Supreme Chancellor reluctantly signed the Treaty of Coruscant, dictated by the Empire. Although years of uneasy peace have followed, the Sacking of Coruscant remains a vivid and painful memory for the Republic; for the Empire, one of its greatest victories." />

    <Body Value="From its humble beginnings twenty thousand years ago as a fleet of Duros scout ships and repurposed Coruscanti trade vessels, the Republic Navy has grown into one of the most formidable armed forces in the galaxy. Under the authority of the Senate, the Republic Navy has been involved in almost every major military action in the Republic's history. However, centuries of simple peacekeeping duties took their toll when the Empire began the Great War. The Republic Navy's losses--particularly over the Hoth system--have forced it to scale down patrols in the Outer Rim and outlying systems.&#xA;&#xA;Today, the Republic Navy relies heavily on its Thranta-class corvettes, flexible and deadly warships that are usually deployed in small battle groups and stocked with squadrons of Republic fighters. But the greatest strength of the Republic Navy lies in its Valor-class cruisers, enormous capital ships capable of taking on an Imperial dreadnought. Due to the massive investment of resources and crewmen, Valor-class vessels are normally held back to the Core Worlds. " />

Some are &quot;merely&quot; repositories of incredible lore, while others possess virtual personalities of their own, modeled after their creators.&#xA;&#xA;Many believe it was actually the Sith who first developed holocron technology, as the oldest known examples are all relics of the dark side. Interestingly, Jedi holocrons take the form of a glowing cube, while Sith holocrons are usually pyramid-shaped. Some scholars claim the six-sided cube of the Jedi represents a more modern and advanced version of the original four- and five-sided pyramids favored by the Sith, though hard evidence for this idea is scarce." />

Once the laser has bored a shaft, a gravity funnel draws the resulting material up to the mining station. Automated systems inside the station sift the ore and begin the initial stages of processing.&#xA;&#xA;Since Makeb's mines often bore into the heart of the planet or take advantage of existing volcanic vents, the operators have developed sophisticated heat-shielding technology. Marketing these shields has been almost as lucrative as the mining itself. " />

Traditionally, a Dark Council member's apprentice is the first choice to replace that council member upon his death, but Zhorrid's relative youth and lack of public achievements resulted in arguments behind closed doors. Nonetheless, Zhorrid wields considerable personal power--and she may be the only Sith alive to possess her father's esoteric secrets." />

The Ulgo tradition of requiring every member to serve in the military has produced generations of distinguished officers. &#xA;&#xA;In recent years, the Ulgos became increasingly frustrated with the political stalemate in the Alderaanian parliament. When the queen died and House Thul returned from exile with the support of the Empire, General Bouris Ulgo pleaded with the collected nobles to act quickly to push Thul back off the planet. When it became clear the nobles were too fractured to stop what he saw as a second Imperial invasion, Bouris Ulgo declared himself king and declared war on House Thul. Unfortunately, grabbing the crown forced the hand of the other noble houses and they declared war against Ulgo. House Ulgo now finds itself beset on all sides as it struggles to defend the crown and brutally reinstate order on Alderaan--no matter the cost in blood and resources." />

But after watching the Imperial invasion tear apart the Outer Rim, there was only so much he could take. When the Mandalorian blockade of the Hydian Way began to strangle the life out of the Core Worlds, Zale was one of the first smugglers to sign up to break it.&#xA;&#xA;Following that victory, he gladly went into service as a Republic privateer. Having won the respect of many with his heroics at the blockade, Zale acted as admiral of the Free Spacers Fleet, a battle group that went on to route the Empire's Third Fleet over Dantooine and remove the Seventh Fleet from Imperial service. The defense of Coruscant during the Imperial invasion was the last action Zale's fleet ever saw, but he wasn't through with the Republic just yet.&#xA;&#xA;For the last several years, Zale Barrows has served as &quot;ferryman&quot; to Belsavis, transporting the most dangerous criminals in the galaxy to the Republic's secret prison.

Enormous urban centers inhabited by thousands of Hutts are few on Hutta; instead, the planet's industrial towns are scattered across the globe, ruled like city-states by whichever Hutt rises to the top.&#xA;&#xA;Jiguuna is one such industrial town, serving as an operational hub for nearby factories, mines and processing centers. Booming and influential two centuries ago, Jiguuna fell into anarchy when its founder, Bakuush the Hutt, died in a mechanical accident. Afterward, Jiguuna's population of humanoid enforcers, workers and slaves fought for scraps under a succession of would-be ganglords.&#xA;&#xA;Eventually, a Hutt called Nem'ro eliminated his competitors and declared himself Jiguuna's new ruler. Since then, Jiguuna has been on an upswing, facilitating the distribution of shvash gas, spice and weapons. Competition with neighboring Hutts has brought gang warfare back to town, but business goes on, and Nem'ro controls the locals with bribes and brute force." />

This in turn allowed the poisonous Quesh venom to rise up from the depths of Quesh and seep to the surface, leaving the atmosphere toxic to this day.&#xA;&#xA;Quesh has been geologically stable for thousands of years now, but this has not stopped the Three Families from investing heavily in early warning systems; tremors one one-hundredth the size of the Quake could wipe out their refineries. Republic geologists have considered exploring the deepest caves exposed by the Quake, but until the caves are mined clear of Quesh venom, they are far too toxic to enter.&#xA;" />

Rich mineral deposits in Makeb's mesas, combined with the settlers' credits and influence, made it an immensely profitable world within fifty years.&#xA;&#xA;Makeb's wealth and independence from the Republic attracted corporate leaders, rich tourists and banking enterprises, and luxury resorts quickly became commonplace. The Hutt Cartel took notice of a new economic power and attempted to invest its own resources, but was rebuffed by Makeb's business consortiums. Nevertheless, individual Hutts persisted in working their way into Makeb society, laying the groundwork for conquest.&#xA;&#xA;During the war between the Empire and the Republic, Makeb stubbornly retained its independence.

    <Body Value="Thanks to centuries of isolation and an obsession with &quot;pure&quot; Sith bloodlines, the Empire has institutionalized its prejudice against non-human species. But a few Imperials take this prejudice to new levels, seeing aliens not merely as inferior but as a plague to be wiped out. These extremists are outside the Imperial mainstream and represent a counterpart to the progressive movement that recently opened the gateway for aliens to become Sith.&#xA;&#xA;Commander Vergost is an ideologue who has spent his career pursuing the elimination of &quot;alien filth.&quot; Although respected for his effectiveness by the Moffs, his own obsessions have limited his advancement inside the Empire. When he realized that the Hutt Cartel's favor might be gained through the elimination of the Evocii population, he saw it as a chance at vindication--an opportunity to prove, once and for all, that his terrible science of mass murder could directly benefit the Empire." />

The very utterance of their name would send ripples of dread throughout the political halls of Coruscant.&#xA;&#xA;All that changed when the Corsairs' home base on Carida was discovered and raided by a Republic strike force. Without a center of operations, the remaining Corsairs were either picked off or scattered to the winds. Over time, the Carida Corsairs became something of a laughing stock, often depicted in popular fiction as ineffectual bunglers. But the remaining Carida Corsairs, often identified by their Kowakian Monkey-Lizard accomplices, have moved on to more remote parts of the galaxy, like Rishi. They have kept their name out of pride, hoping that one day they will be powerful enough to call Carida their home and strike fear into the Republic once again." />

It will not be celebrated, and only in the softest of voices in the most secure locations will it be discussed. Acting largely on their own, the Dark Council's Darth Marr and Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan have agreed to a temporary truce amongst their forces, going so far as to plan and act in concert against their common foe, the Revanites.&#xA;&#xA;If these coalition forces are successful--if they can put aside their differences long and well enough to stop Revan's mad scheme--it could be seen as a bridge to a more permanent agreement. While some might welcome such a scenario, others are all too content to see their differences worked through on the battlefield. They would never compromise their ideologies, even if doing so could spare the lives of millions." />

    <Body Value="Few planets have been as important to both sides of the war as Manaan. But with its surface covered completely by water, and with its native Selkath population having adopted an isolationist stance, access to the planet can be difficult to come by. The Selkath economy's reliance on the export of kolto to the Republic and the Empire does provide opportunities to visit, but guests are typically limited to the world's few trading platforms--the only surface structures not affected by the Empire's bombardment of the planet during the Great Galactic War.&#xA;&#xA;Millennia of Rakatan dominion over the planet and a predominantly unexplored ocean floor evoke strong temptations to probe Manaan's crushing depths. However, due to the strategic importance of its kolto reserves, Manaan will have to largely remain a mystery for now." />

Inside, visitors to the Senate tower are encouraged to enjoy the guided tours or peruse the holographic statues of famous Senators." />

To outsiders, they can appear incomprehensibly hostile--but while virtually all encounters with Sand People end in violence, their culture is more complex internally.&#xA;&#xA;Sand People have strict taboos against showing exposed flesh except in very rare and specific circumstances and keep themselves wrapped in heavy coverings. Those who violate this sacred custom are banished from the tribe; a fate that typically ends in a lonely death in the desert. Despite their insular nature, Sand People are known to adopt and raise young children of other species orphaned by their attacks. Once these orphans reach adulthood, they are encouraged to leave the tribe and return to their own people.&#xA;&#xA;The history of the Sand People is maintained through the tales of revered tribal storytellers. Many of their legends describe a golden age of technological miracles, seemingly indicating the Sand People were once a highly advanced civilization. This had led to speculation that the Ghorfa are descended from the now extinct Kumumgah species that lived on Tatooine roughly thirty thousand years ago. " />

The duel, and the oppressive feeling of evil on Athiss's surface, drove Chamma close to the dark side of the Force. Shaken by the experience, he went into a self-imposed exile; it was almost a century before he came to terms with what he had seen and felt on Athiss, and was able to return to the order.&#xA;&#xA;The many ruins on Athiss have never been properly studied.

Through Yonlach's training, he developed a strong bond with the Padawan and believes she will use her abilities to someday lead the Jedi to greatness." />

When his apprentice Xerender battled Darth Baras, Wyellett joined Xerender and sought to redeem the Sith; failing, Wyellett seized Baras's lightsaber and chose to use it as his own, a symbol of darkness brought into the light.&#xA;&#xA;Wyellett's final heroic act was an act of self-sacrifice committed to save his Padawan Xerender and much of the Jedi Council from the legendary Starweird Queen; this resulted in his capture by the Empire. The Imperial starship that was transporting Wyellett was destroyed in the Battle of Hoth, and Master Wyellett has been believed dead all these years. In fact, Wyellett has been in a trance beneath the rubble of the fallen ship, psychically trying to reach out to his former pupil. Now, Wyellett has transcended the concerns of this galaxy and his powers are more realized than ever before.&#xA;" />

When the sprawling metropolis was reduced to rubble, countless pollutants were released into an already tainted ecosystem.&#xA;&#xA;But this was not the end for Taris. For hundreds of years, the planet went without sentient interference, and the ecosystem began to adapt and thrive. Rich vegetation grew within the ruins, scaling steel towers and thrusting aside fallen skyscrapers. Animals--some native to the planet, some pets and lab specimens that had survived the bombardment--bred and repopulated the developing jungles.&#xA;&#xA;Of course, some areas remain too polluted to inhabit--acidic lakes and radioactive sinkholes--but for the most part, Taris is an environmental success story and an object of fascination for scientists. The largest black mark remains the rakghoul plague, and the fear that it may one day spread to Taris's animal population." />

Many of those theories could very well be correct.&#xA;&#xA;There is ample evidence that those who had reached retirement age were sent to Medical Services for a final health examination that implemented an &quot;electrochemical mental therapy session&quot; to leave the retiree &quot;free from the traumas brought on by a protracted period of service.&quot; Some whose information or abilities were deemed too valuable for such &quot;therapy&quot; were forcibly retired to highly secure locations like Nar Shaddaa's Shadow Town.

Although these three are the most powerful houses on Alderaan, might is not the only path to survival. In many cases, a larger noble house will take a smaller, like-minded one under its protection. Referred to as a &quot;vassal,&quot; these smaller houses typically provide support and fealty to the larger.

When a character is the target of an enemy stun, sleep, knockdown, blind, or ballistic effect, that character gains an amount of resolve points. This value is based on the type of effect and its duration, with stronger effects like stun and knockdown generating more resolve than weaker effects like sleeps and blinds. Additionally, if there are control effects currently active on the target, subsequent control effects add a smaller amount of resolve based on the strength and remaining duration of those effects.&#xA;&#xA;Gaining resolve points fills up the character's resolve with a purple bar. Once the resolve bar fills completely up the bar turns white and the character becomes immune to further control effects. When all current control effects expire the resolve bar begins to decay to zero resolve, at which point the character once again can be controlled and the building process starts anew." />

    <Body Value="Shortly after the end of the war between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, a series of scandals revealed corruption inside Ord Mantell's government. Both local journalists and an official Republic Senate investigation proved vital in removing the corrupt cabinet members, but at the same time, a small but vocal group of citizens decided they'd had enough.&#xA;&#xA;The protesters declared that the Republic wasn't doing enough to stop Ord Mantell's criminal leaders from exploiting common citizens and that any official investigations were &quot;half-measures.&quot; These separatists demanded the planet's independence. Unsurprisingly, neither the Republic nor Ord Mantell's leaders were prepared to answer the cries for secession.&#xA;&#xA;No one realized how powerful and well-organized the separatists had become until a massive coordinated bombing attack destroyed every major spaceport across the planet. The destruction left the world in chaos, crippling its economy. As the government retaliated against the separatists, Ord Mantell descended into civil war.&#xA;&#xA;The separatists' terms for peace are simple: resignation of Ord Mantell's entire government, trials and imprisonment of its criminal leaders and the immediate recognition by the Republic of the world's independence. With a seemingly inexhaustible supply of fresh recruits armed with military-grade weapons, the separatists show no signs of backing down from this fight." />

The cult foresaw an era where scarcity and physical limitations ceased to exist, and all people lived in peace.&#xA;&#xA;Teha's apprentice Bezar One, who assumed leadership after Teha's death, took the cult in a new direction. The New Men began a series of violent raids to procure equipment, murdering anyone who interfered, and began plans for a city-wide &quot;electric ascension&quot; that would have empowered the cyborgs and cost of millions of lives.&#xA;&#xA;The plot was thwarted, and Bezar One and his lieutenants were imprisoned on Belsavis. Since then, the New Men have recruited new members, improvising cybernetic implants by stealing droid parts and performing surgery in secret. Amazingly, relatively few of the New Men's recruits die during their initiation--for all their madness, the cultists know what they're doing." />

Far larger than any rakghoul ever previously recorded, these creatures make their home near the very heart of the outbreak. Sensor probes and scouts have never found more than one such creature in each tunnel network.&#xA;&#xA;No two THORN scientists can seem to agree on the role of the Eyeless in the rakghoul heirarchy. Some theorize that they are actually the source of the outbreaks, where others believe them to be a mere byproduct of the plague's progression. Until more detailed scans are made available, definitive answers on the nature of the Eyeless will likely remain out of reach." />

    <Body Value="For the Voss, a Mystic's vision is a rare and solemn event. While visions are always believed to serve the greater good of the Voss people, in the short term they can mean great upheaval and suffering. Following the visions of their Mystics, the Voss have waged bloody war on one another, torn down and rebuilt half of Voss-Ka and spent centuries digging underground in search of sacred crystals--but experience has shown that those who ignore visions do so at their peril. The predictions of the Mystics have never been wrong.&#xA;&#xA;For these reasons, a Mystic's vision is treated with great care. No Mystic determines himself how the Voss act upon his vision; instead, the vision is described to the experienced interpreters at the Tower of Prophecy. The interpreters debate its meaning and meditate before they present their analysis, and the Three--or another to whom the vision is directed--act on the interpretation, confident in the knowledge that whatever action is necessary, it is ultimately for the benefit of all Voss." />

Running contraband not only places a smuggler at odds with a planet's law enforcement, but its criminal elements as well.

Only those who possess the sharpest instincts, sturdiest freighters and quickest blasters live long enough to earn a good living at this game.&#xA;&#xA;It's worth noting that not all smugglers are profiteers. Some style themselves as heroic blockade runners or patriotic privateers, delivering hope and much-needed supplies to those who need it. Of course, that's also exactly how the real criminal types describe themselves, and law enforcement officers rarely accept &quot;I was serving a noble cause&quot; as an excuse." />

    <Body Value="One of two new species discovered by Jarn Harvus on Nim Drovis, the harvap can be found on several planets and has thrived on heavily industrialized worlds in particular. Originally a carrion-eater, the harvap has adapted to other ecosystems by feeding on industrial waste and garbage in addition to its normal diet.&#xA;&#xA;Harvap infestations have plagued Hutt Space due to the density of industry and the generally lax decontamination procedures used when moving cargo from world to world. On Quesh, the byproducts of venom mining and processing have created a particularly strong breed of harvap that can thrive in the toxic atmosphere.&#xA;" />

In fact, the Mystics' visions are first interpreted, then conveyed to the Three--the secular governing body based in Voss-Ka, who base their executive orders upon the visions' interpretations.&#xA;&#xA;The Three are chosen by Mystics after meditation or according to visions, but have little direct contact with the Mystics on a day-to-day basis. Working from the Tower of Prophecy, the Three administer Voss-Ka, make policy decisions and coordinate the endless war against the Gormak. &#xA;&#xA;Depending on the advice of the Mystics, appointment to the Three can last a lifetime or just hours. The current members of the Three are the calm, authoritative Sonn-Vi; Gunta-Mer, who was chosen by the Mystics only weeks ago; and Nen-Ji, the longest-serving member, who has been part of the Three since childhood." />

They poured money into establishing a defensive point between their headquarters and the Republic base, and in a matter of days, the war camp was set up, supplied and staffed--an object lesson in how Hutts react when their credits are at stake.&#xA;&#xA;Broga, the head of the Three Families, spends much of his time at the war camp since his private palace was captured by the Empire. His role is twofold: firstly, overseeing his forces as they coordinate with the Republic military, and secondly, ensuring that Republic forces are not passing on any of the Three Families' secrets concerning the handling of Quesh venom.&#xA;" />

The collective's technologists have since performed many important services for Malgus, such as incorporating the technology of the ancient Foundry into the Emperor's captured space station. They have also augmented the weaponry used by Malgus's forces with Rakata devices and perfected the production of his stealth fleet. Malgus holds up the Schism Collective as an example of alien ingenuity that the old Empire was foolish to reject." />

    <Body Value="Bogwings are dangerous reptavian carnivores who often live near lakes or marshes. When they hunt, they skim the ground or marsh at high speed, using their long jaws to snatch up prey or strain the water for fish. Larger creatures are grasped in the bogwing's heavy front claws, which are surprisingly powerful for its size. Observations show that if a bogwing is hungry enough, it can tackle animals several times its own weight. &#xA;&#xA;Because of this trait, during the Great War the Republic military briefly considered training bogwings to carry supplies or even munitions to squads in remote areas. However, bogwings are extremely temperamental and respond badly to being handled. The risk to potential trainers was judged to be too high, and the idea was never widely implemented." />

Soon these smugglers found that as Kellie quickly grew so did her appetite, making her cost-prohibitive as a pet. Fearing the prospect of bankruptcy, the Scoundrels' leader callously dumped Kellie into a garbage scow where the kell dragon gorged herself on irradiated refuse for days, likely accounting for both her intimidating stature and surly disposition." />

    <Body Value="One of the great conundrums facing modern war strategists is how to defend a planet from orbital bombardment without encircling it in a costly permanent defense fleet. Most major governments employ planetary shields as a countermeasure, but these offer no protection against dropships bearing armies whose first objective is to destroy shield generators.&#xA;&#xA;The war technologists of Balmorra spent decades researching an offensive method of protecting their planet. The result is the Barrager superweapon, a series of planetary scale turbolasers that can target and destroy whole enemy fleets in orbit, neutralizing both bombardment vessels and landing parties in one fell swoop.&#xA;&#xA;For years, the primary obstacle preventing completion of the Barrager was the enormous power costs associated with such a weapon. How its engineers overcame this dilemma is unknown, but at last report the weapon was nearly ready to go online.&#xA;" />

It maintained a close relationship with the Republic, but remained aloof of most galactic struggles due to the strength of its corporations--including Okara, Balmorran Arms and Traken Industries. As a leading weapons and droid manufacturer, Balmorra was a corporate-run oligarchic democracy, centered on the capital of Bin Prime. &#xA;&#xA;The Empire took pains to leave the corporate hierarchies intact when the occupation began in an effort to smoothly transition back to full industrial production. Corporate executives who refused to cooperate were forcibly removed and replaced, and today's Balmorran corporations are puppets for the Empire--sometimes eager, often not.&#xA;" />
